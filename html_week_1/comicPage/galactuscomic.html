            I don't like the looks of this. Terrax said <strong>Galactus</strong> was weak, but he's holding his own against Thor and Iron Man together!

            I ain't so sure of that, Torchie. Is it my <div class="bump bump10">imagination...</div>

            ...or does <strong>Galactus</strong> look...smaller?

            It's not imagination, Ben. <strong>Galactus</strong> is using his energy reserves <br>faster than his body can replenish them. He's actually dwindling<br> <div class="bump bump50">in size.</div>
